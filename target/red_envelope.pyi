"""
This module provides functions to simulate the distribution of red envelopes
and analyze the expected distribution of money among recipients.

Functions:
    distribute_envelope(n: int, envelope_money: int = 20000) -> list[int]
        Simulates the distribution of a red envelope to `n` people and returns
        a list with the amount of money each person gets.

    analyze_red_envelope(simulation_times: int, n: int, envelope_money: int = 20000) -> list[float]
        Performs a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the expected distribution
        of money for `n` people over a specified number of simulations.
